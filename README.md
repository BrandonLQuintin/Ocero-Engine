# A Game Engine made from scratch in C++ and OpenGL!

# Cool Facts About The Game
1. This engine always runs above 1,000 FPS on a steam deck (you must run in native resolution on an external 1080p monitor and steam proton).
2. This engine always runs above 2,000 FPS at the Elms College computer lab (with the RTX 2070-Super, and modern i7 processor), and often runs above 2,500 FPS. Occasionally, it even reaches above 3,000 FPS.
3. The total file size of the engine is 25.5 MB, but without .wav music files, the engine is 7.54 MB.
4. 4,051 lines of code was written to make this engine (as of release version 1.0.0).

# Quintin-Professional-Programming-Project

Runs in the Code::Blocks IDE (MingW 64 bit compiler, version 20.03) and on Windows:
1. Go to your cloned reposity folder
2. Go to "source" folder -> then open "Quintin 3D engine.cbp"

If running the code errors out, try this:
1. Go to file explorer and type %appdata%
2. Go to Roaming -> CodeBlocks
3. Copy default.conf (from the cloned repository) and put it into that CodeBlocks folder

With terrain generation and collision, I followed ThinMatrix's youtube tutorials for OpenGL (tutorial 14, 21, and 22)
